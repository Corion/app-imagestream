=head1 CONFIGURATION

=head2 C<< output DIR >>

=for config
    repeat  => 1,

Output directory

Specifies the output directory into which the output will be written.

Example:

  output 'C:/ImageStream/';

May appear only once.

=head2 C<< theme DIR >>

Theme

Specifies the theme directory to use. You can use a themepack (.tar.gz)
or a directory.

If you don't want to modify the theme itself but replace or customize
parts of it, you can specify the directory to use. Multiple themes
will successively modify each other. The last theme mentioned will be
the one overriding the previous settings. Files that are not modified
by a later theme will be used from the earlier theme.

Example:

  theme 'fancy.tar.gz'; # use the fancy theme
  theme 'my_images/';   # but use images from my_images/ directory

=for config
    repeat  => 1,
    default => 'plain',

=head2 C<< collect DIR >>

Collect images from

Lists a single directory, from which all files will get collected.
Files in subdirectories will also be collected.

Example:

  collect 'C:/Photos';

=head2 C<< reject REGEX >>

Rejection list

A single expression or substring for files or directories that will
not get collected.
This is convenient for excluding backup directories etc.

Example:

  reject 'Copy of ';

=head2 C<< cutoff COUNT >>

The number of days we look backwards in history to create the image stream.

Example:

  # show all files touched in the last week
  cutoff 7;

Default:

  cutoff 3;

May appear only once.

=head2 C<< minimum COUNT >>

The minimum number of files that will always be shown, even if you have not
changed enough files recently.

Example:

  # show 150 images minimum
  minimum 150;

Default:

  minimum 100;

May appear only once.

=head2 C<< exclude_tag TAG >>

Lists tag information that will be used to exclude images
from publication.

Example:

  exclude_tag 'family';

=head2 C<< size NAME, SIZE >>

Specify a size of images to be created. The size will specify
the maximum width and height.

Example:

  size 'thumbnail', 160;
  size 'medium', 1024;

Default:

  size 'thumbnail', 160;
  size 'medium', 800;
  size 'large', 1600;

=head2 C<< prefer EXT, EXT >>

If you have image files that are the by-product of other files,
like bitmap files created by exporting vector files, this allows
you to prefer the better-quality files over their otherwise identical
derivatives.

Example:

  # Prefer RAW files over JPG images
  prefer '.cr2', '.jpg';
  
  # Prefer SVG over PNG and JPG
  prefer '.svg', '.png';
  prefer '.svg', '.jpg';

=head2 C<< author NAME >>

Name of the author

This sets the author that is displayed for all images in the
Atom and RSS feeds.

Example:

  author 'A. U. Thor';

=head2 C<< canonical_url URL >>

=for config
    default => 'http://datenzoo.de/image_stream/imagestream.html',

Canonical URL under which the gallery+feed can be reached

Example:

  canonical_url 'http://datenzoo.de/image_feed'

=head2 C<< base URL >>

=for config
    default => 'http://datenzoo.de/image_stream/',

Base URL under which the gallery+feed can be reached

Example:

  base 'http://datenzoo.de/image_stream'

If this is not specified, the canonical URL will be shortened by
one component and used.

=head2 C<< title NAME >>

Title of your feed

Example:

  title 'All my pictures'

=head2 C<< hero_image filename >>

=for config
    hero_image => 'my_hero_image.jpg',

Hero image which will be used as the top image
for the image gallery.

Example:

  hero_image 'my_hero_image.jpg'

The path is (currently) taken as relative to the theme. If you want
to override something, place it in the customized/ folder.

=head2 C<< inkscape PATH >>

=for config
    repeat  => 1,
    default => 'C:\\Programme\\Inkscape\\inkscape.exe',

Path to your Inkscape executable

This is used to locate the Inkscape program, which is needed to

Example:

  inkscape 'C:/Program Files/Inkscape/inkscape.exe'

=head2 C<< jobs COUNT >>

This is used to specify the number of parallel threads of execution
that will be launched to convert images.

Example:

  jobs 4

=head2 C<< verbose LEVEL >>

=for config
    default => 1,

Output progress level

This is the level of verbosity. 0 means no output except in error cases.
Default is 1. Maximum is 99.

Example:

  verbose 2

=head2 C<< manifest >>

=for config
    default => undef,

Output a HTML 5 MANIFEST file

Example:

  manifest 'index.manifest'
